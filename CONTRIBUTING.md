CONTRIBUTING
============

Contributions are welcome, and are accepted via merge requests. Please review these guidelines before submitting any merge requests.

## Guidelines

* Shell code should be strictly following the POSIX standard without relying on syntax or commands of other shells.
* Send a coherent commit history, making sure each individual commit in your merge request is meaningful.
* You may need to [rebase](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing) to avoid merge conflicts.
